Mandelbrot plot play

Prompted by Redit post by Adam Reed and his pastebin code https://pastebin.com/mr8stzKx
which inspired a wave of nostalgia for early 90's Mandelbrot fever and my first ever pass at doing this in QBasic (After reading James Gleick's 'Chaos'). Memories of the awesome fractint https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractint. A chance to practice some code optimisations and try some of the mindblowing python that JeanFrancoisPuget has done https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/How_To_Compute_Mandelbrodt_Set_Quickly?lang=en
